Knight Battler

Knight Battler is an overworld/turn-based battle game in which you control the hero, Knight Man, and battle enemies through four levels.
Knight Man can be moved throughout the on-screen map using the W, S, A, and D keyboard keys. Each level has an exit for you to find to continue on to the next. 
When Knight Man intersects with an enemy, a turn-based battle ensues. Use your mouse to select Knight Man's attack and deplete the enemy's health before it defeats you.
Reach Level 4 and locate the treasure chest to win the game.
